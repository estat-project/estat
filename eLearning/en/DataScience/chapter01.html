  <h5>Statistics</h5>
  <div class="mainTable">
       Data such as the population, land size, and number of households have been used to describe a country for 
       thousands of years, enabling us to know how large a country's territory is and
       how many people live there. These data were essential for a ruler to govern a country. 
       The origin of the word <b>Statistics</b> comes from the word 'state' which implies a tool 
       for governing a country. Ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome used data such as population and farmland area 
       to manage their country. We call these kinds of summarizing data <b>descriptive statistics</b>.
    <p>
       The probability concept and inference were introduced in the 8th to 13th centuries. Arab mathematicians 
       Al-Khalil (717–786),  Al-Kindi (801–873), and Ibn Adlan (1187–1268) later developed the early statistical inference 
       using sample frequency analysis. 
       The mathematical foundations of modern statistics were laid from the 17th to the early 19th century, with the development of probability theory by Gerolamo Cardano, Blaise Pascal, and Pierre de Fermat. Adrien-Marie Legendre first described the method of least squares in 1805.
       In the late 19th century, Francis Galton and Karl Pearson transformed statistics into a rigorous 
       mathematical discipline used for analysis in science, industry, and politics. 
       Galton introduced the concepts of standard deviation, correlation, and regression analysis.
       Pearson developed the product-moment correlation coefficient and the method of moments to fit distributions
       to samples. In the early 20th century, Ronald Fisher first used the term 'Statistics.' 
       All these research are related to estimating the parameter of an unknown population, and it is called  
       <b>inferential statistics</b>.  
    <p>
       Today, statistical methods are applied in all fields that involve decision-making for making accurate inferences 
       from a collated body of data and for making decisions under uncertainty based on statistical methodology. 
       The use of modern computers has expedited large-scale statistical computations and has also made possible new methods
       that are impractical to perform manually. Modern statistics is the discipline that efficiently collects data, 
       summarizes data, and analyzes it to make scientific decisions using various probabilistic models for decision-making 
       in uncertain situations.
  </div>
  <p>

  <div class="mainTable">
       Making decisions in uncertain situations where statistics can help appears in many parts of 
       our society. Statistics have a wide variety of applications in various fields of society, as follows. 
    <p>
       <div class="textL30M10">
        - A company predicts sales for the next year based on past sales and other data.
       </div>
       <div class="textL30M10">
        - The government establishes long-term and short-term economic development plans through 
          statistical analysis based on economic indicators such as price indexes.

  <h5>Data Science</h5>
  <div class="mainTable">
       Modern digital computers, first developed in 1946 by John Eckert and John Mockley of the University of Pennsylvania, 
       began to be applied to reality in the 1960s and have made tremendous progress in the past half-century and 
       brought many changes in our society. In the 1980s, with the development of personal computers (PC) and 
       communication technology, mainframe computers started to connect, and then PCs were connected 
       to the mainframe computers using the internet. In the 2000s, a mobile phone called a ‘smartphone,’ 
       a combination of computers and traditional telephones, appeared and was connected to computers via wired 
       and wireless network technologies. Nowadays, almost all kinds of computers and mobile phones worldwide 
       are connected to high-speed internet, which radically changes our society.  
    <p>
       The development of computer and communication technologies is now intensified with the <b>Internet of Things (IoT)</b>
       in which all electronic devices are connected to computers via the Internet. In the near future, we expect 
       a society that utilizes artificial intelligence, and IoT which will be radically different from the present, 
       such as an automatic car, a robot doctor, and a robot teacher, and is called the 
       <b>fourth industrial revolution society</b>. 
       The development of technologies has created massive data, called <b>Big Data</b>, which includes
       structured data and unstructured data 
       that were unimaginable in the past. Typical examples of big data include data from Google's search records, 
       social media messages by mobile phones, weblogs by internet connections, and telephone records of 
       global telecom companies. Big data is expected to grow and increase exponentially in the future. and 
       hyper-forecasting is also expected to be possible. 
       The analysis of big data is so enormous and diverse in the amount of data 
       that it can not be fully utilized just by traditional statistical approaches. We must apply simultaneously 
       theories of statistics, computer science, mathematics, management, and related disciplines
       to analyze and utilize big data. <b>Data science</b> is a new area of study in which statistics, 
       mathematics, computer science, and other disciplines are fused to analyze and utilize the big data that 
       emerged this century. Although data science is closely related to statistics, it is not statistics itself. 
       While statistics provides insights to help you make the right decisions, 
       data science goes one step further and focuses on creating the best possible solutions to solve problems.
       To do data science, you need to have business sense, programming, statistics, and mathematics.

       <div class="figText">&lt;Figure 1.1.1&gt; Data science is a new area to analyze the big data</div>
    <p>
       The success or failure of each individual, group, company, and even country depends on how 
       big data is utilized efficiently. Many examples of data science analyze big data and apply it to reality.
    <p>
       <div class="textL30M10">
        - A car sales company could predict the number of car models sold next month in the United States 
          by analyzing questions about buying cars on Google's search engine. 
       </div>
       <div class="textL30M10">
        - A Venezuelan food chain company achieved a 30% increase in sales by analyzing the data from each branch
          that had been distributed, improving inventory management, and establishing a corresponding product sales strategy.
       </div>
       <div class="textL30M10">
        - An online shopping mall analyzed web logs to understand the taste of members' customers and 
          what products they were interested in, and customized advertisements to each customer, which increased sales. 
       </div>
       <div class="textL30M10">
        - An oil exploration company analyzed terabytes of geological data, raising the success rate of oil drilling. 
       </div>
       <div class="textL30M10">
        - An insurance company in South Africa analyzed the big data on claims for existing insurance and 
          implemented an algorithm to find possible insurance fraud cases The company used it to uncover 
          many insurance frauds and even large insurance fraud organizations. 
       </div>
       <div class="textL30M10">
        - A university in the U.S. analyzed data generated when students clicked on the system in an online class
          to monitor each student's learning performance. The university was able to propose class content 
          tailored to the student's understanding and suggest subjects to be taken in the future. As a result, 
          the degree acquisition rate has improved greatly.
       </div>
    <p>
       Methodologies that are used in the analysis of big data include many traditional statistical methods 
       such as estimation, testing hypotheses, multivariate statistical analysis, and linear models. 
       Recent theories in mathematics, such as neural network, supporting vector machines, and theories 
       in computer science, such as distributed computing, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, are also used. 
       Since data science is a fusion of studies, understanding several disciplines is not easy, 
       but it would be generally feasible for those with a talent for mathematics. Those who studied  
       data science could be leaders of the Fourth Industrial Revolution society.

  <p>

  <h5>Data Science, data mining, machine learning, and artificial intelligence</h5>
  <div class="mainTable">
       The definition of <b>data science</b> can vary depending on scholars, but it is generally used to encompass all statistical, 
       mathematical, and computer science techniques that analyze big data. Recently, with the development of big data analysis,
       similar terms such as data mining, machine learning, and artificial intelligence have been used, and 
       they are closely related and overlap each other. It is not too much of a stretch to understand them 
       as part of data science, but if we must distinguish them, they are as follows. The term 
       <b>data mining</b> was first used in big data analysis, which implies extracting patterns 
       or knowledge within data using statistical and mathematical models. People used the patterns and 
       knowledge extracted to make crucial decisions. Mining refers to extracting gold or minerals from mines, 
       but we meant data mining to mean extracting important patterns or 
       knowledge from data. The terms '<b>pattern analysis</b>' or '<b>knowledge extraction</b>' might be 
       more appropriate, but the data mining is to emphasize the fact that big data is analyzed. 
    <p>
       <b>Machine learning</b> has been used extensively, especially in computer science. 
       Instead of humans creating models and analyzing data, the computer automatically learns rules 
       from data to create a software program that solves problems. Unlike data mining, the subject that uses rules or patterns 
       in machine learning is not a person but a computer. However, most of the techniques used in machine learning are 
       similar to those used in data mining. In addition, while data mining algorithms are relatively 
       transparent in creating rules, machine learning algorithms are often like a black box, 
       making it difficult to know why decisions were made. What data scientists do is to analyze data and to create such models. 
       Collecting and analyzing data is very important to data scientists because creating a model is relatively easy
       if good data is prepared. However, if the data is a mess, no matter how good the algorithm is,
       creating a model that works properly is impossible.
    <p>
       <b>Artificial intelligence</b> (AI) is an extension of machine learning that refers 
       to machines, that have the intelligence to imitate human intelligence and perform complex tasks like humans. 
       The artificial intelligence utilizes many techniques in the data mining and machine learning, especially the 
       <b>artificial neural network</b> model is the most important tool for artificial intelligence. 
       <b>Deep learning</b>, which is often seen these days, is a simulation algorithm that trains the 
       artificial neural network.  
    <p>
       In the early days of artificial intelligence, efforts were made to create machines similar to
       humans by imitating the human brain and way of thinking. In 1955, Marvin Minsky and others at Dartmouth College
       in the United States built the first neural network, the SNARC system. Around the same time, 
       computer scientist Viktor Glushkov in the Soviet Union created the All-Union Automatic Information Processing System
       (OGAS). With the development of computer science, rather than implementing human intelligence, 
       efforts were made to solve real-world problems using machines efficiently.  
       However, due to the limitations of information processing capabilities at the time, applications of the AI 
       were limited. 
       In 1974, Paul Warboss proposed a back-propagation algorithm that could solve a multilayer neural network, and research 
       on artificial intelligence using multilayer neural network models was actively conducted, resulting in visible results 
       such as character recognition and primitive speech recognition, but the algorithm sometimes failed to find a solution.
       In 2006, Geoffrey Hinton announced the <b>deep learning</b> algorithm to solve the problem of the
       back-propagation algorithm, which became the higher-level concept of artificial neural network.
       In particular, in 2012, Alex Krizhevsky and Ilya Sutskever built AlexNet, a convolutional 
       neural network architecture, and won the computer vision competition called "ILSVRC" with overwhelming performance, 
       and the deep learning became an overwhelming trend surpassing the existing methodology. In 2016, Google DeepMind's
       AlphaGo popularized deep learning methods and showed results that surpassed human levels in several fields.  
    <p>
       Artificial intelligence began to change significantly in 2022 with the emergence of <b>generative AI</b>. 
       OpenAI's ChatGPT and Drawing AI, which are representative generative AI, have finally begun to be applied to 
       actual personal hobbies and work applications, and the practical application of AI, which had seemed like a dream, 
       has finally begun. The background of this generative AI was the transformer structure. However,
       generative AI has led to active discussions about AI, and among them, theories of caution and threats to AI 
       have also begun to emerge.

       The collected data can take many forms, such as structured data with numbers and characters, spreadsheet files, 
       or data scattered across multiple databases and unstructured data with texts and documents. 
       Exploratory data analysis and preprocessing, cleaning the collected data, and making a data warehouse
       are the first tasks in data analysis. We sometimes select only task-relevant data when the data is so big 
       and include unnecessary data for our data analysis. 
       Data visualization to explore data is discussed in Chapter 2.
       Chapter 3 discusses preprocessing, removes noise or duplicate data, and performs normalization, 
       discretization, or mathematical transformations.
       Chapter 3 also discusses selecting features suitable for data analysis and 
       dimension reduction. Data preprocessing is tedious and time-consuming in the overall 
       data analysis task, but we can obtain useful information if preprocessing is done well. 
       Software programs are essential for these processes. 
    <p>
       Data are usually classified based on their attributes for later analysis, and Section 1.3 discusses 
       data classification. Building a model for knowledge discovery in data is the primary function of 
       data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.
       We review basic probability theory and statistical analysis techniques in Chapters 4 and 5, 
       such as testing hypotheses and regression analysis to build a model for data analysis. 
       The data modeling process determines which analysis method is appropriate for the given problem
       and establishes a model. In Chapters 6 and 7, supervised machine learning models and classification analysis discuss 
       models or functions that describe and distinguish classes or concepts for future prediction,
       such as decision trees, Bayes classification functions, neural networks, support vector machines,
       and ensemble models.
       Unsupervised learning models and clustering analysis are discussed in Chapter 8.
       Clustering models form new classes when the class label is unknown by grouping data 
       with the principle of maximizing the intra-class similarity and minimizing the interclass similarity
    <p>
       Post-processing includes evaluating the models, analyzing results such as 
       visualizing or extracting, summarizing, and explaining only meaningful analysis results 
       to use the data analysis results for decision-making efficiently. 
    <p>
       Chapter 9 introduces the application of data science to artificial intelligence, text mining, web mining, etc.
       Additional study for advanced theories in Statistics, Mathematics and Computer Science is necessary to understand 
       Data Science in depth.

  <h3 id="0103">1.3 Data classification</h3>
  <p>
  <div class="mainTable">
       Data are values or characters observed or measured on interesting characteristics from one person 
       or object to another. A characteristic that varies from one person or object to another is called a <b>variable</b>. 
       For example, if you examine college students' gender and height, there are two variables: gender and height. 
       A measurement for gender can be in the form of 'Male' or 'Female', and its data can be
       'Female', 'Male', ‘Female’, ... , etc., which are a collection of characters. A measurement for height 
       can be 180cm or 170cm, and its data are a collection of numerical numbers such as 180cm, 165cm, 158cm, 175cm, ... , etc.
    <p>
       Variables such as gender, marital status, and eye color are called <b>qualitative variables</b>, and their data
       are called <b>qualitative data</b>. Most qualitative variables are categorical, yielding non-numerical data
       with categories. Values of a qualitative variable are sometimes coded with numbers, for example, 
       zip codes representing geographical locations or '1' for males and '2' for females. 
       We can not do arithmetic calculations with numbers such as zip codes and coded gender. 
       Documents that consist of texts are also qualitative data.
    <p>
       Variables such as height, weight, and years of education are called <b>quantitative variables</b> which yield 
       numerical data. Quantitative variables can be classified as either discrete or continuous. 
       A <b>discrete variable</b> is one whose possible values can be counted, which implies that it is either finite or countably infinite.
       A discrete variable usually involves a count of something, such as the number of cars owned by a family 
       or the number of students in a class. A <b>continuous variable</b> is a variable whose possible values
       are uncountable real numbers. Typically, a continuous variable involves measureing something, 
       such as a person's age, the weight of a newborn baby, or the fuel mileage of a car. 
       Suppose we measure the height of a student. In that case, we usually write it with an integer value,
       such as 180cm, which looks like a finite number, 
       but the height is not a discrete variable because 180cm is an approximation of an actual real number 
       such as 180.123456 and therefore, the height is a continuous variable.   
       We can transform quantitative data into categorical data by dividing all possible values of a quantitative 
       variable into non-overlapped intervals. For example, we can transform age data into categorical data 
       using a transformation such as '< 30', '&ge; 30 ~ < 40’, '&ge;40 ~ < 60', '&ge; 60'.
       Types of variables are summarized graphically in &lt;Figure 1.3.1&gt;.
    <p>
       <img class="figure70" src="./figure/Fig010301.png">
       <div class="figText">&lt;Figure 1.3.1&gt; Types of variables</div>
  </div>
  <p>

  <div class="mainTable">
       Data are values of a variable. Depending on the type of variable, data can be classified as qualitative or quantitative.
       If data are quantitative, they can be classified as either discrete or continuous. 
       Each piece of data is called an observation, and the collection of all observations for a particular variable
       is called a data set, but sometimes it is simply called data.
       Understanding data types is essential to apply an appropriate statistical method for data. 
       The method of processing data and its statistical analysis are different depending on the type of data,  
       for example, different types of graphs are used to visualize for qualitative data and quantitative data. 
       Frequency tables are used for summarizing qualitative data, and summary measures are used for quantitative data.
    <p>
       The qualitative data can be divided into either raw data or frequency table data to do data analysis 
       using a software program. For example, if ten students in an elementary school are examined based on their gender,
       such as follows,
    <p>
       <span class="textLeft">male, female, male, female, male, male, male, female, female, male. </span>
    <br>
    <br>
       this data is referred to as the <b>raw data</b> of the gender variable and can be arranged in a single column 
       of Excel sheet as Table 1.3.1. 
   <p>
       <table style="width:350px">

       If you count the number of male students and female students in Table 1.3.1, there are six male students 
       and four female students, and this can be summarized in Table 1.3.2, which is called A <b>frequency data</b>

  <h3 id="0104">1.4 Software programs for data analysis</h3>
  <p>
  <div class="mainTable">  
       A computer software program is essential for practicing techniques in data analysis.
       Software programs for data analysis date back to the 1960s, and they were developed by using
       early programming languages such as FORTRAN and COBOL for routine data processing. 
       A software program specialized in data processing and analyses
       is called a <b>statistical package</b>, and it is essential to apply statistical methods for practical use. 
       The first statistical package, SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences), was developed 
       for statistical analysis in the 1960s. Since then, many statistical packages such as S, BMDP, SAS,  
       STATA, MINITAB, etc., have been developed. 
       SPSS has evolved to be user-friendly and is still widely used for data analysis today. 
       In the 1970s, SAS, which combined databases and statistical packages, was developed,
       and this software evolved to be widely used for big data analysis.  
       SAS and SPSS still have a large market share worldwide for big data analysis, 
       but they are commercial and very expensive. In the 1990s, Ross Ihaka & Robert Gentleman 
       (University of Auckland in New Zealand) developed an open source system R which is free from charging and 
       allowed users to develop their own specialized package by using R core functions. 
       Nowadays, R and Python have so many valuable and specialized packages for big data analysis 
       which provide powerful libraries for data analysis and visualization. 
       In recent years, the advancement of machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch has further 
       advanced, enabling complex data-driven insights across a variety of industries.
    <p>
       However, software programs such as SPSS and SAS, etc., are very costly, and R and Python are not easy 
       to learn requiring an understanding of a computer language. Also, the software programs are not specialized
       for learning complicated data science theories. It makes authors develop  
       a web-based software program, called 『eStat』, which is specialized for learning theories and  
       data processing practice. 『eStat』 is also free of charge and has a user-friendly interface, 
       especially for beginners to study statistics and data science, 
       『eStat』 includes many useful dynamic graphical tools for visualizing data and machine learning 
       techniques. We can study theories and practice them simultaneously. 
       Since 『eStat』 is specialized for learning data science, other software programs 
       are also essential to practice big data analysis. R and Python, also free software programs,
       are adopted in this book for practicing big data analysis.

       Data science software offers numerous benefits that significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness 
       of the data analysis process. First, it provides powerful tools for data manipulation, visualization, 
       and statistical analysis, allowing users to extract meaningful insights from complex data sets. Additionally, 
       these software programs often integrate machine learning algorithms, allowing organizations to build 
       predictive models to facilitate informed decision-making. Furthermore, many data science programs
       facilitate tem collaboration by providing a centralized environment for sharing code, results, 
       and visualizations. It does not only streamlines workflows but also fosters innovation through collective problem-solving. 
       Ultimately, leveraging data science software allows businesses to leverage the potential of their data fully 
       to improve operational efficiency and competitive advantage. 
       However, data science software faces challenges such as integrating diverse data sources, ensuring data quality,
       managing algorithmic complexity, and addressing ethical concerns such as privacy and bias. 
       Overcoming these obstacles requires skilled personnel, practical tools, and a commitment to ethical practices.
