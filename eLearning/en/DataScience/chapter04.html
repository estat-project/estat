  <div class="mainTable">
       Similar events occur repeatedly or are carried out in our everyday life. Let us consider the following examples.
    <p>
       <div class="textL30M10">
         - A machine repeatedly produces products at a production plant. The product can be either a normal one or a defective one, but it is not known beforehand.
       </div>
       <div class="textL30M10">
         -  I have ordered pizza at home every Sunday. It usually takes 30 minutes for a pizza to be delivered to the house, but the exact time is unknown.
       </div>
    <br>
       These examples have common characteristics as follows.
    <p>
       <div class="textL30M10">
         -  There is repetition of similar events, such as the production of products or pizza deliveries.
       </div>
       <div class="textL30M10">
         -  We know all possible outcomes of events, such as whether the product will be defective or normal and whether the pizza delivery time will be 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes, and so on.
       </div>
       <div class="textL30M10">
         -  But we do not know which outcome exactly will happen. 
       </div>
    <br>
       Events with these three characteristics are subject to study and to apply statistics. 
       An experiment in which a particular outcome occurs among known possible outcomes is called a <b>statistical experiment</b>. 
       In a statistical experiment, the resulting outcome is uncertain and is determined by chance. For example, if you throw a coin, 
       the possible outcomes are either the head or tail, but the resulting outcome will come out by chance, so tossing a coin 
       is a statistical experiment. If a production plant produces products at one machine and their possible outcomes 
       are either defective or normal, then producing a product is a statistical experiment. Also, a pizza delivery time 
       to your home, which takes between 20 and 60 minutes, is a statistical experiment.
    <p>
       In a statistical experiment, the set of all possible outcomes is referred to as a <b>sample space</b>, 
       and a subset of this sample space is referred to as an <b>event</b>. The sample space is usually denoted by S, and events of the sample space are denoted by English capital letters as A, B, and C ... 
       In the example above, a machine produces a product, the sample space is S = {normal, defective} and a subset of the sample space such as A = {defective} is an event. 
       As such, when the number of elements in a sample space is either finite or countably infinite, it is called a <b>discrete sample space</b>. 
       In a statistical experiment of the pizza delivery time to home, the sample space is all possible time between 20 minutes and 60 minutes, i.e. S = { (20,60) }. 
       Delivery time between 20 and 30 minutes ({20,30}) is an event. As such, when the number of elements in a sample space is uncountably infinite, it is called a <b>continuous sample space</b>.
    <p>
       A concept of probability is used to indicate the possibility of an event occurring in a statistical experiment. 
       The <b>probability</b> represents the likelihood of an event occurring using a number between 0 and 1. 
       If an event is likely to occur, the probability is expressed as a number close to 1. The probability is expressed as a number close to zero if it is unlikely. Specifically, there are several ways to define the probability of an event using a number between zero and one. We introduce two definitions of the probability, one is a classical definition and the other is a relative definition of the probability.
       Assuming all elements in the sample space are likely to occur equally. The classical definition of probability that an event A 
       will occur, denoted as P(A), in case of the discrete sample space is defined as follows: 
       $$ \small
         P(A) = \frac {\text {Number of elements belonging to an event A}} {\text {Total number of elements in sample space}}    
       $$
       The probability that an event A will occur in case of the continuous sample space is defined as follows.
       $$ \small
         P(A) = \frac {\text {Measurement of elements belonging to an event A}} {\text {Measurement of the total elements of a sample space} }    
       $$
       The measurement can be the length, area, and volume, etc.
  </div>
  <p>
  <div class="mainTableGrey">
       <b>Example 4.1.1</b>
       An office worker went on a business trip to a city, and two restaurants (restaurants A and B) were near his lodging. 
       He hesitated about which restaurant to go to and threw a die to count the number of points that appeared on the top. 
       If he had odd numbers, he would go to Restaurant A; if he had even numbers, he would go to Restaurant B. 
       What is the probability that he would pick Restaurant A?
    <p>
       <b>Answer</b>
    <p>
       The sample space in this statistical experiment, which counts the number of points on the top by throwing a dice, is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, and the number of odd events is {1, 3, 5}, so there are three elements. Therefore, the probability that restaurant A will be selected is 3/6 = 1/2.
  </div>
  <p>
  <div class="mainTableGrey">
       <b>Example 4.1.2</b>
       When I ordered a pizza from home every Sunday, the time it takes for a pizza to be delivered to my home 
       has the same possibility for any time from 10 to 30 minutes (you may have a decimal number). 
       What is the probability that a pizza will be delivered between 20 and 25 minutes?
    <p>
       <b>Answer</b>
    <p>
       The sample space in this example is all values from 10 to 30 minutes collectively { (10,30) }, 
       and where a pizza is delivered between 20 and 25 minutes is the event { (20,25) }. Therefore, 
       the probability of this event is \( \small \frac {(25-20)} { (30-10)}  = 0.25 \) by measuring 
       the distance of the interval.
  </div>
  <p>
  <div class="mainTable">
       We can apply the classical definition of probability to many real problems in calculating 
       the probability. However, the classical definition of the probability may not be possible 
       to assume that all elements of the sample space are likely to occur. For example, checking the quality of
       a product usually results in ‘Good' and 'Defective' and the assumption that each element of the sample space 
       {'Good’, 'Defective'} is likely to occur equally. The <b>relative frequency definition of the probability</b>
       is defined as the rate at which event A occurs when many statistical experiments are conducted 
       under the same condition repeatedly and denoted by P(A). 
  </div>
  <p>
  <div class="mainTableGrey">
       <b>[<span data-msgid="StatisticalProb">Statistical Probability</span>]</b> 
    <p>
       A simulation of a coin toss experiment using 『eStatU』 shows that the relative frequency  
       of ‘Head’ occurrence converges to the probability of one-half. This convergence of the probability
       is called the <b>law of large numbers</b>.

  <h4 id="040101">4.1.1 Calculation rules of probability and conditional probability</h4>
  <p>
  <div class="mainTable">
      There are several calculation rules for calculating complex probabilities. Consider the examples 
      below to explain the rules.
  </div>
  <p>
  <div class="mainTableGrey">
       <b>Example 4.1.3</b> 
       Out of 40 sophomores in the Statistics Department this semester, 25 students are taking Economics, 
       30 are taking Political Science, and 20 are taking both courses. When I meet one of the sophomores, 
       what is the probability of this student taking either Economics or Political Science (one or both)?
    <p>
       <b>Answer</b>
    <p>
       Since 25 students took Economics and 20 students are taking both courses, 25 - 20 = 5 students take only Economics. 
       Also, since 30 students are taking Political Science, 30 - 20 = 10 students take only Political Science. 
       Thus, as shown in &lt;Figure 4.1.1&gt;, the number of students taking either Economics or Political Science is 5 + 10 + 20 = 35. 
       Therefore, the probability of students taking either Economics or Political Science is 35 / 40.
    <p>
         <img class="figure50" src="./figure/Fig040101.png">
         <div class="figText">&lt;Figure 4.1.1&gt; Students who take either economics or political science</div>
    <p>
       Consider students taking both Economics (A) and Political Science (B). The event that a student took 
       both courses, denoted as A ∩ B, is called an intersection event of A and B (&lt;Figure 4.1.2&gt;).
    <p>
        <img class="figure50" src="./figure/Fig040102.gif">
        <div class="figText">&lt;Figure 4.1.2&gt; Intersection events A ∩ B</div>
    <p>
       The event that a student takes either Economics or Political Science (one or both), denoted as A ∪ B,
       is called an union event of A and B (&lt;Figure 4.1.3&gt;). 
    <p>
        <img class="figure50" src="./figure/Fig040103.gif">
        <div class="figText">&lt;Figure 4.1.3&gt; Union Event A ∪ B</div>
    <p>
        Probabilities of these events on this example are as follows: 
    <p>
        <div class="textL40">
          P(A) = 25 / 40 = 0.625 <br>
          P(B) = 30 / 40 = 0.750 <br>
          P(A ∩ B) = 20 / 40 = 0.500<br>
          P(A ∪ B) = 35 / 40 = 0.875<br>
        </div>
    <p>
        The probability of P(A ∪ B) can also be calculated as follows if you look at the &lt;Figure 4.1.1&gt;.
    <p>
        <div class="textL40">
          P(A ∪ B) = P(A) ＋ P(B) － P(A ∩ B) = 25/40 ＋ 30/40 － 20/40  = 0.625 + 0.750 - 0.500 = 0.875
        </div>
    <p>
        That is, the probability of taking either Economics or Political Science, P(A ∪ B), can be calculated by adding 
        the probability of taking each course and subtracting the probability of taking both courses.
    <p>
       <!---*** html for Addition Rule ***--------------------------------------------->
       <b>[<span data-msgid="AdditionRule">Addition Rule of Probability</span>]</b> 
    <p>
       <iframe class="example90" src="./example/040103.html"> </iframe>
  </div>
  <p>
  <div class="mainTable">
       The rule discussed in [Example 4.1.3] is called an <b>addition rule of probability</b>. 
       $$ P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B) $$
       If  A ∩ B = ∅, then the rule becomes as follows:  
       $$ P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B)$$
       In this case, the events A and B are called <b>mutually exclusive</b>. 
  </div>
  <p>
  <div  class="mainTableGrey">
      <b>Example 4.1.4</b>
      In [Example 4.1.3], if 10 students take Economics, 20 students take Political Science, and if no student 
      takes both courses, what is the probability of a student taking either Economics or Political Science?
      <p>
      <b>Answer</b>
      <p>
      In this case, because no student takes both courses, the events in which they take Economics (A) and Political Science (B)
      are mutually exclusive. Thus, the probability taking either Economics or Political Science, P(A U B), is as follows: 
      <p>
      <div class="textL40">
        P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B) = 10/40 + 20/40 = 0.75
      </div>
  </div>
  <p>
  <div class="mainTable">
       Let us consider the example below to find out the multiplication rule of probability. 
  </div>
  <p>
  <div class="mainTableGrey">
       <b>Example 4.1.5</b>
       Students of ADA University come from either Baku or a province. Among the 30 sophomores in the Department of Economics, 
       there are 10 males and 20 females, one male and five females are from the province.
    <p>
       <div class="textL20M20">1) When selecting a student, what is the probability that the student is from the province? </div>
       <div class="textL20M20">2) When I selected a student, the student was female. What is the probability that this student is from the province? </div>
       <div class="textL20M20">3) When I selected a student, the student was from the province. What is the probability of this student being a male? </div>
       <div class="textL20M20">4) When selecting a student, what is the probability that the student is male and from Baku? </div>
    <p>
       <b>Answer</b>
    <p>
        To solve this problem, it is convenient to organize the information given into a cross table as shown below.
    <p>
      <table class="tableL2"> 
        <tr> 
          <th style="width:70px"></td>
          <th style="width:70px">Baku</td>
          <th style="width:70px">Province</td>
          <th style="width:70px">Total</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="tdLeft">Male</td>
          <td class="tdRight"></td>
          <td class="tdRight">1</td>
          <td class="tdRight">10</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="tdLeft">Female</td>
          <td class="tdRight"></td>
          <td class="tdRight">5</td>
          <td class="tdRight">20</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="tdLeft">Total</td>
          <td class="tdRight">24</td>

          <td class="tdRight">30</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>
        If we calculate and insert the blanks in the above table, it is as follows. Let us call the event of the male as M, 
        the female as F, from Baku as B, from the province as C.

       Let us call the event of male as \(\small M \), female as \(\small F\), from Baku as \(\small B\), and from the province as \(\small C \). 
       From the table, probabilities of \(\small P(M ∩ B) \), \(\small P(M) \) and \(\small P(B) \) are as follows:

        \( \qquad \small

          P(M) = 10/30 \qquad
          P(B) = 15/30
        \)
    <p>
       Therefore, the following relationship is satisfied:
    <p>
        \( \qquad \small
          P(M ∩ B) = P(M) P(B)
        \)
    <p>
       The events of male and Baku origin are independent of each other. Note that 
    <p>
        \( \qquad \small
          P(M∣B) = 5/15 = 1/3 \qquad
          P(M)=10/30 \qquad
          \text{so, } \;\; P(M∣B) = P(M).

       In this case, all events of both \(\small M \) and \(\small C \) , \(\small F \)  and \(\small B \) , \(\small F  \) and \(\small C \)  are 
       independent of each other. We call the two attributes, gender and region, independent of each other.

       The following is an example of how to calculate the probability of a complementary event.
  </div>
  <p>
  <div  class="mainTableGrey">
       <b>Example 4.1.8</b>
       There is a box of six products, two of which are defective. What is the probability that at least one defective product will be found when three have been extracted for product testing? Assume that the product is extracted once for inspection without replacement.
    <p>
       <b>Answer</b>
    <p>
       The probability of finding one defective in the three product tests is as follows.
    <p>
        \( \qquad \small
          \frac { _4 C_2 \times _2 C_1 } {_6 C_3 }   = \frac {3}{5}. 
        \)
    <p>
       The probability of finding two defective products is as follows.
    <p>
        \( \qquad \small
          \frac { _4 C_1 \times _2 C_2 } {_6 C_3 }   = \frac {1}{5}. 
        \)
    <p>
       Thus, the probability that at least one defect will be found is 3/5 + 1/5 = 4/5. 
       Another way to calculate this probability is to obtain the probability of an event with no defect 
       (a complementary event) and then subtract it from 1. In other words, the probability that at least 
       one defective product can be calculated as follows.
     <p>
        \( \qquad \small
       1 - \frac { _4 C_3 } {_6 C_3 }   = 1 - \frac {4}{20} = \frac {4}{5}.

  <div class="mainTable">
       The method used in the above example is called a rule of probability calculation using a

  <h4 id="040102">4.1.2 Bayes theorem</h4>
  <p>
  <div class="mainTable">
       In this section, we will introduce Bayes' Theorem, which is widely used in statistics, using 
       the probability calculation learned in the previous section. Let's look at the example below.
  </div>
  <p>
  <div class="mainTableGrey">
       <b>Example 4.1.9</b> Past surveys of a country showed that 10% of the population
       are hepatitis B carriers and 90% are non-hepatitis B carriers. 
       It means that there is a 10% chance that we will meet a person who is a hepatitis B carrier.
       If we let \(\small B\) be the event of being a hepatitis \(\small B\) carrier, \(\small G\) be the event of being 
       a non-carrier, then \(\small P(B)\) = 0.1 and \(\small P(G)\) = 0.9. These probabilities are called
       <b>prior probabilities</b> to identify a person whether he is a hepatitis carrier or not. 
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
       Suppose past surveys showed more information that if a person was tested for an immune response, 
       a positive or negative response was shown. The probability that a hepatitis B carrier person showed  
       a positive response to this test (called the sensitivity of the test) is 95%, and the probability 
       that a non-hepatitis B carrier person showed a negative response (the specificity of the test) is 97%.
       This additional information about the probabilities of the immune response is called as 
       <b>likelihood probabilities</b>. Using these probabilities, we are curious to find the following
       probabilities.
    <p>
       <div class="textL20M20">1) What is the probability that a person will show a positive response 
         when he takes an immune response test?
       </div>
       <div class="textL20M20">2) A person showed a positive response when he took an immune response test. 
         What is the probability that this person is a hepatitis B carrier and a non-carrier?
       </div>
    <p>
       <b>Answer</b>
    <p>
       Let \(\small B\) be the event of being a hepatitis \(\small B\) carrier, \(\small G\) be the event of being 
       a non-carrier, \(\small Y\) be the event of showing a positive response, and \(\small B\) be the event of 
       showing a negative response. The information given in the problem is the probability of a 
       hepatitis B carrier \(\small P(B)\) = 0.10, the conditional probability that a hepatitis B carrier will 
       test positive \(\small P(Y∣B)\) = 0.95, and the conditional probability that a non-hepatitis Bcarrier 
       will test negative \(\small P(N∣G)\) = 0.97. Since events \(\small B\) and \(\small G\), and 
       events \(\small Y\) and \(\small N\) are mutually exclusive events, it is easy to see that 
       \(\small P(G)\) = 0.90, \(\small P(N∣B) \) = 0.05, \(\small P(Y∣G) \) = 0.03. 
       It is convenient to find related probabilities if we summarize the above values with a two-dimensional table 
       as shown below,

    <p>
       The probability that a person will show a positive response when he or she takes an immune response test
       in the question 1) is \(\small P(Y)\) and the probability of a hepatitis B carrier person showing 
       a positive response, \(\small P(B \cap Y)\), and the probability of a non-hepatitis carrier person showing 
       a positive response \(\small P(G \cap Y)\). In other words,
       $$ \small
         P(Y) = \small P(B \cap Y) + P(G \cap Y)
       $$
       This is called a <b>total probability</b> that a person shows a positive response. 
       The joint probabilities, \(\small P(B \cap Y)\) and \(\small P(G \cap Y)\), can be obtained as follows 
       using the multiplication rule of probability.
       $$ \small
       \begin{align}
         P(B \cap Y) &= P(B) P(Y|B) = 0.1 \times 0.95 = 0.095 \\
         P(G \cap Y) &= P(G) P(Y|B) = 0.9 \times 0.03 = 0.027
       \end{align}
       $$
       Therefore,
       $$ \small
         P(Y) = P(B \cap Y) + P(G \cap Y) = 0.095 + 0.027 = 0.122
       $$
       When a person shows a positive response in his immune test, the probability that this person is 
       a hepatitis B carrier in question 2) is the proportion of a hepatitis B carrier and a positive response
       \(\small P(B \cap Y ) \) among all people who tested positive \(\small P(Y) \), which is
       the conditional probabiity  \(\small P(B | Y ) \). From the definition of the conditional probability,
       it can be calculated as follows. 
       $$ \small
         P(B | Y) = \frac {P(B \cap Y)} {P(Y)} = \frac {0.095}{0.122} = 0.779
       $$
       Since \( \small P(Y) = P(B \cap Y) + P(G \cap Y) \), the above formula can be written as follows.
       $$ \small
         P(B | Y) = \frac {P(B \cap Y)} {P(B \cap Y) + P(G \cap Y)}
       $$
       When a person shows a positive response in his immune test, the probability that this person is 
       a non-hepatitis B carrier can be calculated similarly as follows.
       $$ \small
         P(G | Y) = \frac {P(G \cap Y)} {P(Y)} = \frac {0.027}{0.122} = 0.221
       $$
       The probabilities \(\small P(B | Y) \) and \(\small P(G | Y) \) are called 
       <b>posterior probabilities</b> to identify a person whether a hepatitis carrier or not
       using the likelihood probabilities. 
  </div>
  <p>
  <div class="mainTable">
       When the prior probabilities are given, as in the example above, finding the posterior probabilities

       \(\small P(A \cap Y) ,\; P(B \cap Y),\; P(C \cap Y) \) in the cross table using the multiplication rule of probability
       as follows.
       $$ \small
         \begin{align}
         P(A \cap Y) &= P(A) P(Y|A) = 0.40 \times 0.05 = 0.020 \\
         P(B \cap Y) &= P(B) P(Y|B) = 0.50 \times 0.03 = 0.015 \\
         P(C \cap Y) &= P(C) P(Y|C) = 0.10 \times 0.01 = 0.001
         \end{align}
       $$
       Therefore, the total probability of the event that a product is defective, \(\small P(Y) \), is as follows.

  <div class="mainTable">
       There are many similar probability calculations in statistical experiments that are frequently observed around us,
       For example, the problem of tossing coins several times 
       to see how many times the head comes out is similar to counting how many defective products are made 
       from a product line. This problem is similar to counting the number of voters 
       supporting a particular presidential candidate. This section discusses 
       the probability calculations of these frequently observed examples.
    <p>
       Consider a statistical experiment in which a coin is thrown repeatedly two times. 
       If the coin is ideal, the sample space for this experiment is {'Tail-Tail', 'Tail-Head', 'Head-Tail', 'Head-Head’}.
       The probability of an event in which each element of the sample space is produced is 1/4 
       by the classical definition. In most cases, the fact that we are interested in this example will be 
       counting the number of heads or tails. If \(\small X\) is defined as 'the number of heads' in this experiment,
       the possible value of \(\small X\) can be 0, 1, or 2, and we are interested in calculating probabilities 
       that \(\small X\)=0, \(\small X\)=1 or \(\small X\)=2. As such, a function that corresponds to one real number 
       between [0,1] for each element of the sample space is called a <b>random variable</b> (see Table 4.2.1).
       When possible values of a random variable are finite or countably infinite, it is called a 
       <b>discrete random variable</b>. If possible values of a random variable are uncountably infinite, 
       it is called a <b>continuous random variable</b>.

        The random variable \(\small X\) is the mid-term score and its mean and variance are \(\small E(X)\) = 60 and \(\small V(X)\) = 100.

          These four cases are equal to the number of O's in a single seat when there are four seats which is \(\small{}_4C_1\). 
          Since the probability of each event is (0.6)×(0.4)×(0.4)×(0.4), the probability of the Tiger winning once is \(\small{}_4C_1 (0.6)(0.4)^3\).

  <p>
  <div class="mainTable">
       Consider a statistical experiment that measures how long an office worker can get to work from home. 
       Experience shows that commuting usually takes about 30 minutes to get to the workplace if the traffic is not congested. 
       While the result of this experiment will have a real number near 30 minutes, we can generally assume 
       that the sample space of commuting is greater than zero and define a random variable \(\small X\) as 
       the 'commuting time to the workplace.' 
       As such, if a random variable has an infinite number of possible values and it is uncountable, it is called a <b>continuous random variable</b>.
       In the case of the continuous random variable, calculating probability at each value of the random variable is meaningless
       because there are infinite possible values, and the probability at each value is considered zero. Instead of 
       calculating the probability at a single value, the probability of an interval is of interest 
       in the case of the continuous random variable. For example, 'What is the probability of commuting 
       between 25 and 35 minutes?' We can collect data and plot a histogram 
       as in &lt;Figure 4.2.3&gt; and count frequencies and probabilities to obtain this probability. 
    <p>
       <img class="figure70" src="./figure/Fig040203.png">
       <div class="figText">&lt;Figure 4.2.3&gt; Histogram with narrower intervals on many data</div>
    <p>
       If you increase the number of data and close the interval's width to zero, this histogram can be 
       approximated to a continuous function, as shown in &lt;Figure 4.2.4&gt;. 
       This function is called a <b>probability distribution function of the continuous random variable</b>. 
       In real life, many continuous data appear a bell-shaped function, as in &lt;Figure 4.2.4&gt;. 
       The graph shows that large amounts of data are located around their mean, and fewer data are located as it moves away 
       from the mean and is symmetrical about the mean. This type of probability distribution is called a 
       <b>normal distribution</b>. Data obtained from measurements such as the height, weight, and 
       bolt's length often follow the normal distribution.
    <p>
       <img class="figure70" src="./figure/Fig040204.png">
       <div class="figText">&lt;Figure 4.2.4&gt; Probability distribution function of a continuous random variable</div>
    <p>
       If the probability distribution function of a continuous random variable can be expressed as a mathematical function 
       \(f(x)\), we can approximate the desired probability easily without finding the frequency table and histogram.
       The probability of the random variable \(\small X\) at interval (\(a,b) \), denoted as 
       \(\small {P( a \lt X \lt b) }\), can be obtained as the area between 
       (\(a,b) \) of \(f(x)\) as &lt;Figure 4.2.5&gt; which is the integral over (\(a,b) \) as follows: 
       $$
         P(a \lt X \lt b)=  \int_{a} ^{b} {} f(x)dx
       $$
       <img class="figure70" src="./figure/Fig040205.png">
    <p>
       <div class="figText">&lt;Figure 4.2.5&gt; \(P(a \lt X \lt b)\) of a continuous random variable \(\small X\)</div>
    <br>			
       The total area under this function f(x) should be 1, because the addition of all probabilities is 1. 
       $$
         P(-&infin; \lt X \lt &infin;)=  \int_{-&infin;} ^{&infin;} {} f(x)dx = 1
       $$
       The integral at an interval (\(a,b\)) of a function \(f(x)\) is generally difficult to obtain. 
       For a normal distribution function, we use a table to calculate the probability or 『eStatU』 software,
       which will be discussed in this section.  
    <p>
       Many mathematicians tried to find a mathematical function to describe this bell-shaped data type 
       to make it easier to calculate probability.
       Abraham de Moivre (1667-1754) was the first to discover the function, and then Carl Friedrich Gauss 
       (1777-1855) extensively applied to physics and astronomy. This function is called a 
       <b>normal distribution function</b> or a <b>Gaussian distribution function</b> whose  
       functional form is as follows.
       $$
         f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 &pi;} \, \sigma } exp \{ - \frac {(x-\mu)^2 } {2 \sigma^2} \}
       $$
       This distribution function has two parameters &mu; and &sigma;, each representing the mean and 
       standard deviation of the normal distribution. 
       If \(X\) is a normal random variable with mean &mu; and variance \(\sigma^2\) , 
       it is often denoted by a symbol \(X\) ～ \(N(\mu, \sigma^2)\). 
       The following simulation of 『eStatU』, 'Normal Comparison', shows three normal distributions with different mean 
       and variance such as \(N(0, 1)\), \(N(-2, 0.5^2 )\),  and \(N(2, 3^2 )\). We can  
       observe that all of them are symmetrical about the mean. If the variance increases, 
       the normal distribution becomes flat, and if the variance decreases, the normal 
       distribution becomes sharp. This is because the total area under the normal distribution 
       function must be 1.

      Characteristics of the normal distribution can be summarized as following.
    <p>
      <div class="textL20M20">

      </div>
      <div class="textL20M20">
        3) There are an infinite number of normal distributions according to the value of &mu; and &sigma;.

           and the probability of the interval [ &mu; - 3 &sigma; , &mu; + 3 &sigma; ] is 0.997. 
           It implies that the Normal random variable has the most of values (99.7%) around the interval of (mean) &plusmn; 3 (standard deviation) and there are a few values outside of this interval.

  <h5> Probability Calculation of the Normal Distribution</h5>
  <p>
  <div class="mainTable">
       The normal distribution is the most frequently used in statistical methods.  If \(\small X\) is a normal random variable with mean &mu; and variance \(\sigma^2\) , 
       it requires a probability calculation in the interval \( (a,b) \). As described earlier, the probability of \(\small X\) on the interval \( (a,b) \), 
       is the area of f(x) surrounding the X-axis and interval \( (a,b) \) as shown in &lt;Figure 4.2.5&gt;.
       Mathematically, this area can be calculated using the following definite integral over \( (a,b) \), but it is impossible to calculate by hand and can only be calculated using a computer.
       $$
         P(a \lt X \lt b)=  \int_{a} ^{b} {} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 &pi;} \, \sigma } exp \{ - \frac {(x-\mu)^2 } {2 \sigma^2} \}dx
       $$
       If \(X\) is a normal random variable with the mean &mu; and variance \(\sigma^2\), a standardized
       normal random variable \(Z =  \frac {X - \mu}{\sigma} \) follows a normal distribution with 
       the mean 0 and variance 1, i.e., \(Z &sim;  N(0,1)\). This fact implies that, 
       if we can find probabilities of all types of intervals in N(0,1) distribution, then we can also 
       find probabilities of all types of intervals in \(N(\mu, \sigma^2 )\). 
       Therefore, \(N(0,1)\) is called a <b>standard normal distribution</b> or simply \(\small \boldsymbol Z\) 
       <b>distribution</b>. 
       For the standard normal distribution function, the probability \(P(Z \lt z)\) which is the area from the left end (-&infin;) 
       to the value z is calculated using a computer and summarized as in Table 4.2.4. 
       It is called the standard normal distribution table, and Table 4.2.4 is a part of this table obtained using 『eStatU』. 
       This table covers values of z between –3.99 and 3.99 by an increment of 0.01, and four decimal digits of the probability 
       for an interval (-&infin;, z) in the standard normal distribution is calculated. Calculation of the probability 
       using this table is usually enough approximation for practical application.

       In 『eStatU』, the calculation of probability \( P( a \lt X \lt b ) \) for the interval \((a , b)\) of 
       any normal distribution \( N(\mu,\sigma^2) \) can be calculated. Any interval in the range of 
       [ &mu; - 4&sigma;, &mu; + 4&sigma; ] can be calculated. Also, a percentile value \(x\) for 
       a given probability \(p\), which is \(P( X \lt x) = p\), can be easily calculated using the 
       following 'Normal Distribution' module.

       <b>Answer</b>
    <p>
       Using the normal probability table, percentile calculations are as follows: 
       <div class="textL20M20">
       1) The 95 percentile z, \(\small P(Z \lt z) = 0.95\), in the N(0,1) probability table is 1.645, so the percentile in the \(\small  N(70,10^2 )\) is 70 + 1.645 × 10 = 86.45.

       <div class="textL20M20">
       2) The 95 percentile z of two-sided type, \(\small P(z \lt Z \lt z) = 0.95\) , in the \(\small N(0,1)\) table, can be calculated from \(P(Z \lt z) = 0.975\) which is 1.96.

  <div  class="mainTable">
       When data of two continuous variables are highly correlated, if we draw a three-dimensional histogram, 
       the data are concentrated around the mean, and  
       the shape is a bent bell to both sides. We use a model for such data with a <b>bivariate normal distribution</b> 
       If two variables \(X_1\) and \(X_2\) have means \(\mu_1\) and \(\mu_2\), 
       variances \(\sigma_1^2\) and \(\sigma_2^2 \) respectively, and correlation \(\rho\), the distribution function is as follows.
       $$ \small
          f( x_1 , x_2 ) = \frac {1}{2 \pi \sigma_1 \sigma_2 \sqrt{1- \rho^2 } } exp \left \lbrace \frac{1}{2(1-\rho^2 )} \left [ \left ( \frac{x_1 - \mu_1 }{\sigma_1 } \right )^2 -2 \rho \left ( \frac{x_1 - \mu_1}{\sigma_1} \right ) \left ( \frac{x_2 - \mu_2}{\sigma_2 } \right ) + \left ( \frac{x_2 - \mu_2}{\sigma_2 } \right )^2 \right ] \right \rbrace 
       $$
       Several snapshots of the bivariate normal with means (0, 0) and variances (1, 1) for different 
       correlations are as follows.
       &lt;Figure 4.3.1&gt; shows the case where the bivariate normal distribution with mean (0, 0), 
       variance (1, 1) and \(\rho\) = 0. This special case is called the circular normal distribution. 
       Here, we have a perfectly symmetric bell-shaped curve in three dimensions.

    <br>
       As ρ increases, the bell-shaped curve becomes flattened on the 45-degree line. So for \(\rho\) = 0.5, &lt;Figure 4.3.2&gt;, 
       the curve extends towards minus 4 and plus 4 and becomes flattened in the perpendicular direction.

       If \(\rho\) is increased to 0.9, &lt;Figure 4.3.3&gt;, the curve becomes broader, and the 45-degree line and even flatter

       If there are \(m\) random variables such as
       \(\boldsymbol X = ( X_1 , X_2 , ... , X_m ) \) whose mean is \(\boldsymbol \mu \) and 
       \(m \times m\) covariance matrix is \(\boldsymbol \Sigma \), the <b>multivariate normal distribution function</b>
       for the random variable \(\boldsymbol X \) is as follows.
       $$

       Let the sample data \( {\boldsymbol x}_1 , {\boldsymbol x}_2 , ... , {\boldsymbol x}_n \) be the observed values ​​
       of random variables \( {\boldsymbol X}_1 , {\boldsymbol X}_2 , ... , {\boldsymbol X}_n \) and assume 
       that these random variables are independent and follow the same probability distribution  
       \(f({\boldsymbol x} : \boldsymbol \theta )\) where 
       \(\boldsymbol \theta = ( {\theta}_1 , {\theta}_2 , ... , {\theta}_k ) \). 
       In this case, the probability that the sample data 
       \( {\boldsymbol x}_1 , {\boldsymbol x}_2 , ... , {\boldsymbol x}_n \) will appear can be written as follows.
       $$
          f( {\boldsymbol x}_1 , {\boldsymbol x}_2 , ... , {\boldsymbol x}_n : \boldsymbol \theta ) =  f( {\boldsymbol x}_1 : \boldsymbol \theta )  f( {\boldsymbol x}_2 : \boldsymbol \theta ) \cdots f( {\boldsymbol x}_n : \boldsymbol \theta )
       $$
       It is called a <b>likelihood function</b>, which depends on the parameter \(\boldsymbol \theta \). 
       The MLE method is to estimate the population distribution function by finding the parameter \(\boldsymbol \theta\) 
       which maximizes the likelihood function. The maximum value of the likelihood function can be found by
       differentiating \(f({\boldsymbol x} : \boldsymbol \theta )\) with respect to \(\boldsymbol \theta \),
       and set to \(\boldsymbol 0\), and then solve the simultaneous equations as follows; 
       $$
         \frac { \partial  f( {\boldsymbol x}_1 , {\boldsymbol x}_2 , ... , {\boldsymbol x}_n : \boldsymbol \theta ) } {\partial \boldsymbol \theta } =  \boldsymbol 0
       $$
       If the distribution function is easy to differentiate when taking the logarithm, differentiate the 
       log likelihood function and set it to \(\boldsymbol 0\) to solve the system of equations.
       When the maximum value of the likelihood function is \( \hat {\boldsymbol \theta} \), the estimated 
       distribution function is \(f( {\boldsymbol x} : \hat {\boldsymbol \theta} ) \).
    <p>
       If univariate sample data \( {x}_1 , {x}_2 , ... , {x}_n \) follow a normal distribution \(N(\mu , \sigma^2 )\), 
       the estimated parameters for \(\mu\) and \(\sigma^2\) using the maximum likelihood method can be shown as follows.
       $$
         \begin{align}
         \hat \mu      &= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \\
         \hat \sigma^2 &= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \overline x )^2 
         \end{align}
       $$
       When multivariate sample data \( {\boldsymbol x}_1 , {\boldsymbol x}_2 , ... , {\boldsymbol x}_n \)
       follow a multivariate normal distribution \(N(\boldsymbol \mu , \boldsymbol \Sigma )\),
       the estimated parameters \(\boldsymbol \mu\) and \(\boldsymbol \Sigma\) using the maximum likelihood method 
       can be shown as follows.
       $$
         \begin{align}
         \hat {\boldsymbol \mu }  &= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} {\boldsymbol x}_i \\
         \hat {\boldsymbol \Sigma} &= \frac{n-1}{n} \boldsymbol S 
         \end{align}
       $$
       where \(\boldsymbol S\) is the sample covariance matrix.
