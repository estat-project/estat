    <div class="mainTable">
      <p>Since a population is generally very large, a survey of the entire population takes lots of time and money. Hence we are trying to estimate characteristics of the population using a set of samples. Estimation of population characteristics using samples is called an inferential statistics. However, there may be some difference between the characteristic of the population and the characteristic of the sample. In order to reduce the difference, several methods of sampling have been studied. The most commonly used one is a simple random sampling which collects samples with the same probability of all elements of the population being selected. 
    </div>
    <p>
    <div class="mainTableYellow">
      <b>Simple Random Sampling</b>
      <p>
      Samples are collected so that all elements of the population are likely to be selected equally.
    </div>
    <p>

    <div class="mainTable">
      In case of the simple random sampling, there are two possible ways to collect samples. One is to include an element selected once again in the population (with replacement), and the other is not to include the selected element back into the population (without replacement). However, in practice, almost all sampling is made without replacement.
      <p>
      Some tools may be needed to ensure that each element of the population is selected equally. 
      We usually use a random number table which is a table of numbers from 0 to 9 without special regularity or 
      partiality. Recently, a random number generator by using a computer which uses the uniform distribution 
      on [0, 1] is widely used to produce a random number. 『eStatU』 provide random number generators for Uniform, 
      Normal and two dimensional Normal distributions.

      <b>Example 6.1.1</b>
      A class has 50 students. Select three of 50 students as samples without replacement by using 『eStatU』. 
      <p>
      <b>Answer</b>
      <p>
      In order to select three samples randomly from 50 students, a list of students which assigned serial numbers 
      from one to fifty must be made first. In order to collect samples, select [Random Number Generator] in 『eStatU』 menu.
      Enter (1 and 50) at the box of ‘Uniform’, ‘Integer (without replacement)’, enter 3 at the box of ‘Number of Data’ and click 
      the [Execute] button as shown in &lt;Figure 6.1.1&gt;. These are the random numbers to select students, 
      but your computer might generate different numbers, because it depends on computer.

  <h4>6.1.1  Sample Survey</h4>
  <p>

    <div class="mainTable">
         Simple random sampling is the basic sampling method for all sample surveys on a population. 
         When the characteristics of a population are estimated using a sample, a difference occurs 
         between the estimated value using the sample and the characteristic value of the population,
         which is called a <b>sampling error</b>. Many sampling methods have been studied to reduce 
         this sampling error.
      <p>
         Each element of the population that is the subject of analysis is called an <b>elementary unit</b>
         or an <b>observational unit</b> because it is the object that is actually observed in the survey. 
         Depending on the sampling method, these elementary units can be selected individually 
         (e.g. simple random sampling method), or a set of elementary units can be selected for convenience
         of sampling. Therefore, what is selected to construct a sample is called a <b>sampling unit</b>, 
         distinguishing it from an observational unit. In order to select samples by the sampling unit,
         a table of the sampling units is required, which is called a <b>sampling frame</b>. Describing 
         how to select samples using the sampling frame is called a <b>sampling design</b>.
      <p>
         In order to conduct a good sample survey, it is necessary to define accurately the above terms 
         in advance. Since a sample survey is a method of scientific research, all steps for a sample survey 
         must be planned in advance and carried out according to the plan.
    </div>
    <p>

    <div class="mainTableYellow">
      <h4>Steps for Sample Survey</h4>
      <p>
      <div class="textL20M20">
        <b>Step 1</b>. The objective of the sample survey must be clearly established. It helps you always make decisions that are consistent with the objective even while planning and carrying out the detailed process of a complex survey.
      </div>
      <div class="textL20M20">
        <b>Step 2</b>. Check general matters related to the sample survey. For example, determine whether the same or similar survey has not been conducted in the past or whether the sample survey is appropriate, determine the total cost available and determine the reliability and accuracy of the results.
      </div>
      <div class="textL20M20">
        <b>Step 3</b>. Do the sampling design which includes the most important things such as sampling unit, sample size, sampling method, etc. Also, the cost required for each step is calculated.
      </div>
      <div class="textL20M20">
        <b>Step 4</b>. Conduct the designed sample survey. The reliability and usefulness of the sample survey results depend on the accuracy of observation data. Therefore, in order to obtain accurate data, there must be research on how to prepare and use questionnaires, training and management of interviewers, and interviewing methods.
      </div>
      <div class="textL20M20">
        <b>Step 5</b>. Analyze and summarize the data obtained from the sample survey. Sometimes the cost and workload of this step may be greater than that required to obtain the data, so this should also be anticipated in advance. Then, the entire process is reviewed to identify problems which can be served as a reference for future sample survey.
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>

    <div class="mainTable">
      The following sampling methods are often used in large-scale sample surveys rather than simple random sampling. For detailed information on the estimation and variance of population characteristic values by these sampling methods, please refer to the references as it is beyond the scope of this book.
    </div>
    <p>

    <h4>Stratified Sampling</h4>
    <div class="mainTable">
      <b>Stratified sampling method</b> divides the population into an appropriate number of <b>strata</b> and selecting a sample of a fixed size from each stratum using simple random sampling method. For example, if you are interested in the average wage in a population consisting of factory workers, office workerse, and professionals, divide the population into three strata: factory workers, office workers, and professionals. Then, estimate the overall average wage by selecting individuals from each stratum through simple random sampling. Stratification is recommended so that the elements in each stratum are as homogeneous as possible. The variance of the estimated value of stratified sampling is smaller than that of simple random sampling and the cost is reduced.  The stratified sampling method has the advantage of being more convenient administratively.
    </div>
    <p>

    <h4>Cluster Sampling</h4>
    <div class="mainTable">
      In large-scale sample surveys with a large population, it is difficult to prepare a sampling frame, 
      expensive to survey widely scattered sampling units, and difficult to manage the survey. 
      To solve this problem, for example, when trying to investigate entertainment expenditures by household
      living in Seoul, if a household (it is called a <b>cluster</b> because there may be many household members)
      is the sampling unit, all basic regional administrative units in Seoul are listed and 
      then some regional units are selected by simple random sampling. In the selected regional units, 
      some households are selected by simple random sampling and then survey all members in the household. 
      The sampling method from a population using a group of elementary units, that is a <b>cluster</b>, 
      as a sampling unit is called a <b>cluster sampling method</b>.
    </div>
    <p>

    <h4>System Sampling</h4>
    <div class="mainTable">
      Suppose you want to get a quick estimate of total sales by examining 2% of a department store's 
      sales slips, approximately 1000 slips each week. 20 sales slips need to be investigated. 
      For this purpose, if the sales slips are filed and stored in sales order, one slip is selected 
      between the first slip and the 50th slip and then continue selections from every 50 slips. 
      For example, if it was the 7th slip, the next is the 57th, 107th, 157th, ... , 957th slip. 
      This is called a <b>systematic sampling</b>, in which one slip is selected out of every 50 slips. 
      Here, 50 is called the <b>sampling interval</b>, and the starting point 7 is called the 
      <b>random starting point</b>, and can be determined randomly within the sampling interval.

    <div class="mainTable">
      The purpose of statistical experiments or surveys is to find out some information about a population. Information about the population usually refers to a characteristic value of the population, such as the mean and variance which are called parameters. Since it is so difficult or costly to investigate the population parameters, they are usually estimated by using characteristic values of a set of samples such as the sample mean and sample variance. &lt;Figure 6.2.1&gt; is a simulation to show the relationship between population data of size 10,000 and sample data (approximately 10%) using 『eStatU』 which shows characteristic values of a population are similar to characteristic values of a set of samples.

    <div class="mainTable">
      Characteristic values of a set of samples are called sample statistic and the distribution of the sample statistic is called a sampling distribution. The sampling distribution identifies the relationship between the sample statistic and the population parameter and it makes possible to estimate and test a population parameter. In this section, let's first look at the sampling distribution of sample means and find out how to estimate the population mean.

      <b>Parameter, Estimator and Estimate </b>
      <p>
        The population mean is a single value, but there are many possible sample means. 
        The population mean &mu; is called a <b>parameter</b>, which is a characteristic value of the population, 
        and the sample mean is a random variable that can have many different values and is usually expressed with a capital letter such as \(\small  \overline X \)
        which is called an <b>estimator</b> of the parameter &mu;. An observed sample mean, marked \(\small  \overline x \) with a lowercase letter, is called an <b>estimate</b> of &mu;.
      <p>An <b>estimator</b> of the population variance \( &sigma;^2 \) is the sample variance \( S^2 \) and its observed value which is an <b>estimate</b> of \( S^2 \) is denoted as \( s^2 \).
      <p>
    </div>
    <p>
    <div class="mainTable">
      <p>The relationship between the population mean and all possible sample means in [Example 6.2.1] is observed even if the population has a different shape of distribution. If the population is very large, it is not possible to find all possible samples as shown in [Example 6.2.1] and to find a distribution of sample means. Therefore, the following theoretical research has been developed.
      <p>If a population is normally distributed with \( N(&mu;, &sigma;^2 ) \), 
         the distribution of all possible sample means is exactly a normal distribution such as 
         \( N(&mu;, \frac {&sigma;^2 }{n} ) \). 
         If the population is an infinite population with the mean &mu; and variance \( &sigma;^2 \), 
         then the distribution of all possible sample means is approximately a normal distribution 
         such as \( N(&mu;, \frac {&sigma;^2 }{n} ) \) if the sample size is large enough. 
         This is referred to as the Central Limit Theorem, which is a key theory in statistics, specifically summarized as follows.

      <b>[Theorem 6.2.1]&nbsp;&nbsp; Central Limit Theorem</b>
      <p>
      Suppose a population is not a normal distribution and its mean and variance are &mu; and \( &sigma;^2 \). If we select samples of size  with replacement, the distribution of all possible sample means has following characteristics:
      <p>
      <div class="textL20M20">1) The average of all possible sample means, \(\small  &mu;_{\overline X} \), is equal to the population mean &mu;.  (i.e., \(\small  &mu;_{\overline X} = &mu; \) )

      <div class="textL20M20">2) The variance of all possible sample means, \(\small  &sigma;_{\overline X}^2 \), is the population variance divided by \(n\). (i.e., \(\small  &sigma;_{\overline X}^2 = \frac {&sigma;^2}{n} \) )

      <div class="textL20M20">3) The distribution of all possible sample means is approximately a normal distribution.

  </h6>
  <p>

    <div class="mainTable">
      When a sample survey is conducted, only one set of samples is selected from the population to estimate a characteristic value of the population, such as the population mean. In general, we consider the sample mean of selected samples as an estimate of the population mean. Do you think this sample mean can estimate the population mean well even if it is only one set of samples? 
      <p>This is a basic question on the estimation that everyone can think about at least once. 
         The sampling distribution of all possible sample means which we studied in the previous section 
         is the answer to this question. That is, whatever a population distribution is, if the sample size
         is large enough, all possible sample means are clustered around the population mean in the form 
         of a normal distribution. Therefore, the sample mean obtained from one set of samples is usually
         close to the population mean. Even in the worst case, the difference between the population mean 
         and sample mean, known as an error, is not so significant, and it is possible to estimate the 
         population mean by using the sample mean. The larger the sample size, the more sample means are 
         concentrated around the population mean based on the central limit theorem and hence 
         we can reduce the error of the estimation.
    </div>
    <p>

    <h4>Point Estimation of the Population Mean</h4>
    <p>
    <div class="mainTable">
      A value of one observed sample mean is called a <b>point estimate</b> of the population mean.
      <p>In general, the sample statistic used to estimate a population parameter must have good characteristics, so that the estimate can be accurate. 
         If the average of all possible sample statistics is equal to the population parameter, then the sample statistic has a good chance to estimate the population parameter and it is called an unbiased estimator. In the previous section we found that a sample mean is an <b>unbiased estimator</b> of the population mean. 
      <p>If the value of a sample statistic becomes closer and closer to the population parameter when the sample size grows, 
         the sample statistic is called a <b>consistent estimator</b>. The variance of all possible sample means is closer to zero as the sample size increases by the central limit theorem studied in the previous section, so the sample mean is closer to the population mean. Therefore, the sample mean is a consistent estimator of the population mean. 
      <p>If a sample statistic has the least variance when there are several unbiased estimators for the population parameter, 
         it is called an <b>efficient estimator</b>. The sample mean is also an efficient estimator. Consequently, a sample mean has all good characteristics necessary to estimate the population mean.
    </div>
    <p>

    <div class="mainTableYellow">
      <b>Point Estimate, Unbiased, Consistent, and Efficient Estimator</b>
      <p>A value of one observed sample mean is called a <b>point estimate</b> of the population mean.
      <p>If the average value of all possible sample statistics is equal to the population parameter, 
         then the sample statistic is called an <b>unbiased estimator</b> of the population parameter. 
         The sample mean is an unbiased estimator of the population mean. 
      <p>When a sample size grows, if the value of the sample statistic becomes closer and closer to the population parameter, 
         the sample statistic is called a <b>consistent estimator</b>. The sample mean is a consistent estimator of the population mean. 
      <p>If a sample statistic has the least variance when there are several unbiased estimators for the population parameter, 
         it is called an <b>efficient estimator</b>. The sample mean is an efficient estimator. 
    </div>
    <p>

    <div class="mainTableYellow">
      <b>[Theorem 6.2.2]</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Point estimation of the population mean &mu; is the sample mean \(\small  \overline X \)   
      <p>(Note that \(\small  \overline X \) is an unbiased, consistent, efficient estimator of &mu;). 
    </div>
    <p>

    <h4>Interval Estimation of the Population Mean – Known Population Variance</h4>
    <p>
    <div class="mainTable">
      <p>In contrast to the point estimate for the population mean, estimating population mean by using an interval is called an <b>interval estimation</b>. 
         If the population is a normal distribution with the mean &mu;  and variance \(&sigma;^2 \), 
         the distribution of all possible sample means is a normal distribution with the mean &mu; and variance \(\frac {&sigma;^2}{n} \), 
         so the probability that one sample mean will be included in the interval \( &mu; &plusmn; 1.96 \times \frac {&sigma;}{\sqrt{n}} \) is 95% as follows.
      $$\small  
        P(\mu - 1.96 \times \frac {&sigma;}{\sqrt{n}} < \overline X < \mu + 1.96 \times \frac {&sigma;}{\sqrt{n}} ) = 0.95
      $$
      We can rewrite this formula as follows.
      $$\small 
        P(\overline X - 1.96 \times \frac {&sigma;}{\sqrt{n}} < \mu < \overline X + 1.96 \times \frac {&sigma;}{\sqrt{n}} ) = 0.95
      $$
      Assuming &sigma; is known, the meaning of the above formula is that 95% of intervals obtained by applying the formula 
      \(\small  [ \overline {X} - 1.96 \times \frac {&sigma;}{\sqrt{n}}, \overline {X} + 1.96 \times \frac {&sigma;}{\sqrt{n}} ] \) 
      for all possible sample means include the population mean. The formula of this interval is referred to as the 95% confidence interval of the population mean.
      $$\small 
        \left[ \overline {X} - 1.96 \times \frac {&sigma;}{\sqrt{n}}, \overline {X} + 1.96 \times \frac {&sigma;}{\sqrt{n}} \right]
      $$
      <p>Generally, since \(\small  \overline {X} \sim N(&mu;, \frac {&sigma;^2}{n} ) \), the standardized random variable of \(\small \overline X \),
         \(\small Z = \frac {\overline X - \mu}{\frac {\sigma}{\sqrt n}} \), follows the standard normal distribution \(N(0,1)\). 
         Therefore, the following probability of the standard normal random variable \(Z\) is \(1-&alpha;\) . 
      $$\small 
        P \left( -z_{\alpha/2} < \frac {\overline{X} - \mu } {\sigma/\sqrt{n}} < z_{\alpha/2} \right) = P ( -z_{\alpha/2} < Z < z_{\alpha/2} ) =  1 - \alpha
      $$
      This formula can be written as follows: 
      $$\small 
        P \left( \mu - z_{\alpha/2} \frac {\sigma} {\sqrt{n}} <  \overline X  < \mu + z_{\alpha/2} \frac {\sigma} {\sqrt{n}} \right) =  1 - \alpha
      $$
      This formula can also be written as follows: 
      $$\small 
        P \left( \overline X - z_{\alpha/2} \frac {\sigma} {\sqrt{n}} <  \mu  < \overline X + z_{\alpha/2} \frac {\sigma} {\sqrt{n}} \right) =  1 - \alpha
      $$
      The confidence interval for the population mean &mu; is as follows if the population is normally distributed and the population variance \( \sigma^2 \) is known.
    </div>
    <p>
 
    <div class="mainTableYellow">
      <b>[Theorem 6.2.3]&nbsp;&nbsp; 100(1-&alpha;)% Confidence Interval for Population Mean &mu;</b>
      <p>
      Assume a population is a normal distribution and the population variance  is known.  
      $$\small 
        \left[ \overline X - z_{\alpha/2} \frac {\sigma} {\sqrt{n}} , \overline X + z_{\alpha/2} \frac {\sigma} {\sqrt{n}} \right]
      $$
    </div>
    <p>
	
    <div class="mainTable">
      <p>100(1-&alpha;)% here is called a <b>confidence level</b>, which refers to the probability of intervals that will include 
         the population mean among all possible intervals calculated by the confidence interval formula. Usually, we use 0.01 or 0.05 for &alpha;.
         \( z_{&alpha;} \) is the upper &alpha; percentile of the standard normal distribution. 
         In other words, if \(Z\) is the random variable which follows the standard normal distribution, 
         the probability that \(Z\) is greater than \( z_{&alpha;} \) is &alpha;, i.e., 
      $$
        P(Z > z_{&alpha;} ) = &alpha;
      $$
      For example, \( z_{0.025;} \) = 1.96, \( z_{0.95} \) = -1.645, \( z_{0.005} \) = 2.575.  
      <p>&lt;Figure 6.2.6&gt; shows a simulation of the 95% confidence interval for the population mean by extracting 100 sets of samples with the sample size \(n\) = 20 
         from a population of 10,000 numbers which follow the standard normal distribution N(0,1). 
         In this case, 96 of the 100 confidence intervals contain the population mean 0. 
         This result might be different on your computer, because the program use a random number generator which depends on computer. 
         Whenever we repeat these experiments, the result may also vary slightly.

    <h4>Interval Estimation of the Population Mean – Unknown Population Variance</h4>
    <p>
    <div class="mainTable">
      <p>One problem in estimating the unknown population mean by using the formula of the confidence interval in the previous section is that either the population variance may not be known or the population is not normally distributed. If the sample size is large enough, a confidence interval of the population mean can be obtained approximately using the sample variance instead of the population variance on the previous formula. However, if the sample size is small and the sample variance is used, a confidence interval based on the t distribution should be used. 
      <p>The \(t\) distribution was studied by a statistician W. S. Gosset, who worked for a brewer in Ireland, and published his study result in 1907 under the alias Student. 
         So \(t\) distribution is often referred to as Student's \(t\) distribution. The \(t\) distribution is not just a single distribution, 
         but it is a family of distributions under a parameter called a degree of freedom, 1,2, ... , 30, ... and denoted as \(t_1 ,t_2 , ... , t_{30} , ... \)
      <p>
         The shape of the \(t\) distribution is symmetrical about zero (y axis), similar to the standard normal 
         distribution, but it has a tail that is flat and longer than the standard normal distribution. 
         &lt;Figure 6.2.7&gt; shows the standard normal distribution N(0,1) and \(t\) distribution with 3 degrees of freedom at the same time by using the \(t\) distribution module of 『eStatU』.

         </div>
    </div>
    <p>
    <div class="mainTable">
      <p>The \(t\) distribution is closer to the standard normal distribution as degrees of freedom increase above 30. 
         This is why a confidence interval can be obtained approximately by using the standard normal distribution if the sample size is greater than 30. 
         Denote \(t_{n:&alpha;}\) as the 100(1-&alpha;)% percentile of the \(t\) distribution with \(n\) degrees of freedom. 
         For example, \(t_{7:0.05}\) is the 100(1-0.05)=95% percentile of the \(t\) distribution and its value is 1.895 as &lt;Figure 6.2.8&gt;. 
         In the standard normal distribution, this value was 1.645. Since the \(t\) distribution is symmetrical, \(t_{n:&alpha;} = -t_{n:1-&alpha;}\). 
      <p>In order to find a percentile value of the \(t_{7}\)  distribution using 『eStatU』, click on '\(t\) distribution' in the main menu of 『eStatU』 
         and then set the degree of freedom (df) to 7, and set the probability value in the fifth option below the \(t\) distribution graph to 0.95, 
         then \(t_{7:0.05}\) = 1.895 will appear as in &lt;Figure 6.2.8&gt;.

         Consider the interval estimation of the population mean when you do not know the population variance, but assume that the population is a normal distribution.  
         If \( X_1 , X_2 , ... , X_n \) is the random sample of size \(n\) from the normal population, 
         then it can be shown that the distribution of \( \frac {\overline X -\mu}{S/\sqrt{n}} \), where &sigma; is replaced with S, 
         is the \(t\) distribution with \( n-1 \) degrees of freedom. 
      $$\small 
        \frac {\overline X -\mu}{\frac{S}{\sqrt{n}}} \sim t_{n-1}

        As discussed in [Example 6.2.1], the sample variance is also a random variable that can have many values, 
        so it is denoted as \( S^2\) and the observed sample variance as \( s^2\). 
        Table 6.3.1 shows that some of these sample variances are exactly the same as the population variance \( &sigma;^2\) = 8, 
        others such as 0 or 32 are significantly different from 8. The average of all possible sample variances, 
        denoted as \( \mu_{s^2}\), is as follows.

      In order to estimate the population variance, the sampling distribution of all possible sample variances 
      should be used. As discussed in [Example 6.3.1], for an infinite population, the mean of all possible 
      sample variances is the population variance. That is, the sample variance \(S^2\) is an unbiased estimator 
      of the population variance \(&sigma;^2\). Therefore, the sample variance is used to estimate the population
      variance. In addition, estimation of the population standard deviation \(&sigma;\) uses the sample standard 
      deviation \(S\), but it should be noted that the sample standard deviation is not an unbiased estimator of 
      the population standard deviation. However, as the sample size increases, there is no significant error

      <p>If we know the relationship between the population proportion and sample proportion, it is possible to estimate the population proportion. In this section, the distribution of all possible sample proportions is discussed in section 6.4.1 and the estimation of the population proportion using the sample proportion is discussed in section 6.4.2.
    </div>
    <p>

  <h4>6.4.1 Sampling Distribution of Sample Proportions</h4>
  <p>
    <div class="mainTable">
      <p>Consider the sampling distribution of all possible sample proportions by using the following example.
    </div>

    <!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

      <b>Example 6.4.1</b>
      Consider a population consists of only 10 employees of a company. When employees' satisfaction level for the company is investigated and the satisfaction is expressed as 1, the complaint is 0 as follows.
      <p>
      <p class="textLeft">    1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1
      <p>
        That is, the population proportion \(p\) of the satisfaction is 0.6 (6 ‘1’s out of 10). 
        Consider all possible samples of size 5 with replacement to obtain a sampling distribution of 
        sample proportions. (It is to illustrate the sample variance of sample proportions, 
        although it is not necessary to extract samples from such a small population.)
      <p>
      <b>Answer</b>
      <p>
      <p>The population proportion is  \(p\) = 0.6 and the distribution of ‘1’ and ‘0’ in the population consisting of 10 persons is as &lt;Figure 6.4.1&gt;.

        Assume the population is infinite and the population proportion is \(p\). If \(\hat p\) is the sample

        is approximately a normal distribution with the mean \(p\) and variance \(\frac {p(1-p)}{n}\) .

      <p>As explained in section 6.4, the 100(1-&alpha;)% confidence interval of a population proportion
      \(p\) is as follows.
      $$
        \left[ \hat p - z_{&alpha;/2} \sqrt{\frac{\hat p (1-\hat p)}{n} },  \hat p + z_{&alpha;/2} \sqrt{\frac{\hat p (1-\hat p)}{n} } \right]
      $$
      <p>The term \(z_{&alpha;/2} \sqrt{\frac{\hat p (1-\hat p)}{n} }\) which is the half size of 
      the confidence interval is called the <b>maximum allowable error bound</b> to estimate 
      the population proportion and is denoted as \(d\).
      <p>Therefore, if the maximum allowable error bound \(d\) and the confidence level 1-&alpha; are given, 
      the sample size can be determined by solving the following equation. 
      $$
        z_{&alpha;/2} \sqrt{\frac{\hat p (1-\hat p)}{n} } = d
      $$
      The solution of the above equation is as follows.
      $$
        n = \hat p (1-\hat p) ( {\frac{z_{&alpha;/2}}{d}}  )^2

      <b>Example 6.5.2</b>
      For this year presidential election, a survey for estimating the 95% confidence interval of a candidate's approval rating is conducted. Determine the size of the sample to be within 2.5% of the maximum allowable error bound. Check this calculation using 『eStatU』.
      <p>
      <b>Answer</b>
      <p>
      Since we do not have any information on the population proportion, assume \(\hat p\) = 0.5. 
      Then the sample size  can be calculated as follows: 
      <p>
      \( \qquad \small  n = \hat p (1-\hat p) ( {\frac{z_{&alpha;/2}}{d}})^2  = 0.5(1-0.5)\frac{1.96^2}{0.025^2} = 1536.6 \)
      <p>
      Therefore, samples must be extracted with at least 1537 persons to limit the error bound to 2.5%. 
      Various opinion polls conducted nationwide often show that the size of the sample is around 1,500

    <div class="mainTable">
         When producing a product in general, there is a variation in the quality characteristic values 
         even if it is produced under the same working conditions. The causes of the variation can be divided 
         into <b>chance causes</b> that can always occur in the production process and 
         <b>assignable causes</b> that occur due to such as worker's carelessness, use of defective materials, 
         abnormalities in production equipment, etc. If the quality characteristic value varies up to 
         a certain limit around a specific value, it is regarded as a change due to chance causes and 
         is tolerated. If it exceeds the limit, it is regarded as an explainable cause, and the cause 
         is investigated and an action is taken to prevent the occurrence of defective products. 
         If the quality level is monitored by controlling the process to prevent defectives as above, 
         it is called a <b>statistical quality control</b>. One of the statistical tools widely used 
         for this purpose is the control chart which was first introduced by W.A Shewart in 1924.
      <p>
         A <b>control chart</b> is a diagram to manage changes in quality characteristic values. 
         As shown in &lt;Figure 6.6.1&gt;, there is an <b>upper control limit (UCL)</b> at the top, 
         a <b>center line (CL)</b> in between, and a <b>lower control limit (LCL)</b> at the bottom. 
         The characteristic value of an inspected sample in each time are plotted as a line graph. 
         When the quality characteristic values do not exceed the control limit lines and are not related 
         to each other, the process is said to be <b>under control</b>. If the quality characteristic value
         is outside the control limits or, if the characteristic values are related each other 
         even they are within the control limits, the process is said to be <b>out of control</b>.

         <div class="figText">&lt;Figure 6.6.1&gt; Control chart with UCL, CL, LCL</div>
      <p>
         Control charts are divided into a <b>control chart by variable</b> and <b>control chart by attribute</b>.
    </div>
    <p>

  <h4>6.6.1 Control Charts by Variable </h4>
  <p>
    <div class="mainTable">
      A control chart by variable refers to a control chart when the quality characteristic value 
      is a quantitative variable such as temperature, pressure, strength, weight, etc. 
      The quantitative variable has the advantage of being able to obtain a lot of information about 
      quality characteristics, but it has the disadvantage of requiring a lot of purchase and 
      maintenance costs for measuring instruments, and requiring a lot of manpower and time for measurement.
      There are many types of control charts for variable, but the <b>sample mean control chart</b> 
      (\( \overline X \) chart) that uses the sampling distribution of sample means studied in this chapter 
      and the <b>sample range control chart</b> (\(R\) chart) that manage dispersion are commonly used in
      production process. These control charts requires the assumption that the quality characteristic values 
      follow a normal distribution \(N(\mu, \sigma^2 )\). If the quality characteristic value is 
      normally distributed, the distribution is completely determined by the mean \(\mu\) and
      variance \(\sigma^2\). Therefore, if the sample mean and sample range are managed simultaneously, 
      the distribution of the quality characteristic is managed.
    </div>
    <p>

    <h4>Theoretical Background of \( \overline X \) Chart</h4>
    <div class="mainTable">
        The theoretical basis of the sample mean control chart (\( \overline X \) chart) is based on 
        the sampling distribution theory of sample means studied in Section 6.2. If a population distribution
        of quality characteristic values is a normal distribution with a mean of \(\mu\) and variance of 
        \(\sigma^2\), that is \(N(\mu , \sigma^2 ) \) , 
        the sampling distribution of all possible sample means of size \(n\)  follows a normal distribution 
        with a mean of \(\mu\) and variance of \(\frac {\sigma^2}{n}\), that is \(N(\mu , \frac{\sigma^2}{n}) \). Therefore, according to the characteristics 
        of the normal distribution, the interval
      $$
        [\mu - 3 \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}},\quad \mu + 3 \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}]
      $$
        contains 99.74% of all possible sample means. The right limit of this interval is called the 
        <b>upper control limit</b>(\(UCL_{\overline X}\)) of the \(\overline X\) chart, the left limit 
        is called the <b>lower control limit</b> (\(LCL_{\overline X}\)), 
        and \(\mu\) is called the center line (\(CL_{\overline X}\)) as following. 
      $$
        \begin{align}
        UCL_{\overline X} &= \mu + 3 \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \\
        CL_{\overline X} &= \mu \\
        LCL_{\overline X} &= \mu - 3 \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
        \end{align}
      $$
        Since the mean \(\mu\) and standard deviation \(\sigma\) of the quality characteristic values 
        are not known, they are estimated using samples. In a production process that produces 
        a large number of products, several samples of size \(n\) are selected, and the average of 
        all sample means is used to estimate \(\mu\) and the sample variance or sample range is used 
        to estimate \(\sigma\). Estimation of \(\sigma\) using the sample ranges are commonly used 
        in quality control sites because the sample range is an easily understandable statistics to workers. 
      <p>
        Let \( {\overline X}_{1}, {\overline X}_{2}, ... , {\overline X}_{k} \) be the sample means
        obtained by selecting \(k\) samples of size \(n\), and let \( \overline {\overline X} \) be 
        the average of these sample means. Let \( {R}_{1}, {R}_{2}, ... , {R}_{k} \) be the 
        sample range (maximum - minimum) of each sample, and let \(\overline R\) be the average 
        of these ranges as following:
      $$
        \overline {\overline X} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{k} {\overline X}_{i} }{k} , \quad
        {\overline R} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{k} {R}_{i} }{k}
      $$
        The mean \(\mu\) is estimated by using \( \overline {\overline X} \). Since the sample 
        standard deviation \(s\) is not an unbiased estimator of the population standard deviation
        \(\sigma\), \(\sigma\) is estimated by using the mean of the ranges \(\overline R\) and 
        the coefficient \(d_2\) that depends on the number of samples, \(n\), as follows. 
      $$
        \hat \sigma = \frac {\overline R}{d_2}
      $$
        \(\hat \sigma\) is an unbiased estimator of the population standard deviation \(\sigma\). 
       Here, \(d_2\) is a constant that depends on the number of samples, \(n\), and is shown in Table 6.6.1.

         Therefore, the center line (\(CL_{\overline X}\)) and control limit lines of the

      $$

    <h4>Theoretical Background of \( R\) Chart</h4>
    <div class="mainTable">
        When the population distribution of quality characteristic values is a normal distribution 
        with a mean of \(\mu\) and variance of \(\sigma^2\), that is \(N(\mu, \sigma^2 )\), 
        let the sample range of a sample of size \(n\) be the random variable \(R\). The distribution of 
        a random variable \(W = \frac {R}{\sigma}\) which divides the sample range \(R\) by a constant
        \(\sigma\) can be derived theoretically. Let \(d_3\) be the standard deviation of the random 
        variable \(W\) which depends on \(n\). Since the sample range is \(R = W \sigma \), 
        the standard deviation of \(R\) becomes  \(\sigma_R = d_3 \sigma \). Since we do not know \(\sigma\),
        if we use the estimated value, \(\hat \sigma = \frac {\overline R}{d_2}\), the estimated 
        standard deviation of \(R\) will be  \(\sigma_R = d_3 \hat \sigma = d_3 \frac {\overline R}{d_2}\).
        Therefore, the center line and control limit lines of the \(R\) chart are as follows.
      $$
        \begin{align}
        UCL_{\overline R} &= {\overline R} + 3 \hat {\sigma_R} = \overline R + 3 d_3 \frac{\overline R}{d_2} \\
        CL_{\overline R}  &= {\overline R} \\
        LCL_{\overline X} &= {\overline R} - 3 \hat {\sigma_R} = \overline R - 3 d_3 \frac{\overline R}{d_2} 
        \end{align}
      $$
        To make calculations easier, if we let \(D_3 = 1 - 3 \frac{d_3}{d_2}\), 
        \(D_4 = 1 + 3 \frac{d_3}{d_2}\), the center line and control limit lines of the \(R\) chart are
        as follows. The constants \(D_3\) and \(D_4\) are also listed in Table 6.1.1.
      $$
        \begin{align}
        UCL_{\overline R} &= {\overline R}  D_4 \\
        CL_{\overline R}  &= {\overline R} \\
        LCL_{\overline X} &= {\overline R} D_3 
        \end{align}

    <h4>Steps to make \(\overline X\) and \(R\) Charts</h4>
    <div class="mainTableYellow">
         The procedure for creating \(\overline X\) and \(R\) Charts is as follows.
      <p>
      <div class="textL20M20">
        <b>Step 1</b>. In a production process, collect a sample of size \(n\), measure the quality 
           characteristic values, \(x_{11}, x_{12}, ... , x_{1n} \), and calculate the average
           \({\overline x}_1\) and range \(R_1\) as follows. Typically, the sample size ranges from 5 to 20 depending on the production process.
        $$
          \overline {\overline x}_1 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{k} {\overline x}_{i} }{k} , \quad
          {R_1} = max (x_{11}, x_{12}, ... , x_{1n}) - min ( x_{11}, x_{12}, ... , x_{1n} )
        $$
      </div>
      <p>
      <div class="textL20M20">
        <b>Step 2</b>. Repeat Step 1 \(k\) times. In other words, collect a sample of size \(n\)
           repeatedly \(k\) times and calculate their sample means 
           \({\overline x}_{1}, {\overline x}_{2}, ... , {\overline x}_{k}\)
           and sample ranges \(R_{1}, R_{2}, ... , R_{k}\) of each sample. The average of 
           these sample means, \(\overline {\overline X}\), and the average of the sample ranges,
           \(\overline R\), are calculated as follows. The sample size is usually between 20 and 30.
        $$
          \overline {\overline x} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{k} {\overline x}_{i} }{k} , \quad
          {\overline R} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{k} {R}_{i} }{k}
        $$
      </div>
      <p>
      <div class="textL20M20">
        <b>Step 3</b>. Calculate the control limit lines as follows.
        <p>
          \(\overline X\) Chart:
          $$
            \begin{align}
            UCL_{\overline X} &= \overline {\overline x} + A_2 \overline R  \\
            CL_{\overline X} &= \overline {\overline x} \\

            \end{align}
          $$
      </div>
      <p>
      <div class="textL20M20">
        <b>Step 4</b>. Draw \(CL\), \(UCL\), \(LCL\) of \(\overline X\) chart and \(R\) chart. 
        Mark the sample mean \({\overline x}_ i\) and sample range \(R_i\) of each sample as a dot. If a point exceeds the control limit line,
        mark it  clearly so that it can be easily distinguished.
      </div>
      <p>
      <div class="textL20M20">
        <b>Step 5</b>. After examining the \(\overline X\) chart and \(R\) chart, make a judgment whether 
        the process is under control or not. If each sample mean and sample range do not exceed the control limits,
        or there is no correlation in the arrangement of points (e.g., when consecutive points are above 
        the center line and then again when consecutive points appear below the center line), 
        the process is said in state which is under control. In this case, the prepared control charts 
        should be used for the next process. If the process is in state which is out of control, 
        the cause should be investigated and the control limit lines should be redrawn using the quality 
        characteristic values which are under control.

      <b>Answer</b>
      <p>
         The average of 25 sample means and sample ranges are as follows.
         $$
           \begin{align}
           \bar {\bar x} &= \frac { 1.0 + 0.75 + \dots  +(-1.0)} {25  } = \frac{ 5.25} {25 } = 0.21  \\
           \bar{R} &= \frac{7+11+ \dots +4} {25} = \frac {236} {25} = 9.44
           \end{align}
         $$
      <p>
         Therefore the control limits of \(\overline X\) chart are as follows.
         $$
           \begin{align}
           UCL_{\overline X} &= 0.21 + (0.729)\times(9.44) = 7.09 \\
           LCL_{\overline X} &= 0.21 - (0.729)\times(9.44) = -6.67
           \end{align}
         $$
      <p>
         The control limits of \(R\) chart are as follows. 
         $$
           \begin{align}
           UCL_{R} &= (2.282) \times (9.44) = 21.542 \\
           LCL_{R} &= (0) \times (9.44) = 0

    <h4>6.6.2 Control Chart by Attribute</h4>
    <p>
    <div class="mainTable">
       When managing the quality of a product, quality characteristics such as weight, length, 
       and temperature cannot be measured sometimes and we can only judge whether the product ‘passes’ 
       or ‘fails’. In this case, <b>control charts by attribute</b> are used. A control chart 
       for the defective fraction rate (\(p\) chart) and a control chart for the number of defective items 
       (\(C\) chart) are commonly used. \(p\) chart is explained only In this book. Please refer 
       other references for \(C\) chart. .
    </div>
    <p>

    <h4>Theoretical Background of \(p\) Chart</h4>
    <p>
    <div class="mainTable">
       Assume that in one production process, the product is produced with the defective rate \(p\)
       and maintained at a constant level. If we select a sample of size \(n\) from this production process,
       the number of defective products included in the sample follows a binomial distribution 
       as discussed in Chapter 5. In other words, if the defective rate of products in the process is \(p\),
       and let the random variable X be ‘the number of defective products in the sample of size n’, 
       the probability density function \(f(x)\) of X is as follows.
       $$
         f(x)= \frac{n!}{x!(n-x)!} p ^{x} (1-p) ^{n-x} \quad x=0,1, ... ,n
       $$
       The mean of X is E(X) = \(np\) and the variance of X is V(X) = \(np(1-p)\). Therefore, 
       if the defective rate of the process is \(p\), the mean and variance of the defective rate of 
       a sample, \(\hat p = \frac {X}{n}\), are  E(\(\hat p\)) = \(p\), 
       Var(\(\hat p\)) = \(\frac{p(1-p)}{n}\). The distribution of the defective rate of a sample, \(\hat p\), 
       follows approximately a normal distribution when the sample size, \(n\), is sufficiently large. 
       In general, if the defective rate of the process, \(p\), is not a value very close to 0 or 1 
       (usually  \(np\) > 5, \(n(1-p)\) > 5 is considered satisfactory), \(\hat p\) follows 
       approximately a normal distribution \(N(p, \frac{p(1-p)}{n} )\). Therefore, the following 
       interval includes approximately 99.74% of all possible sample defective rates due to the characteristics of the normal distribution.
       $$
         [p - 3 \sqrt {\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}, p + 3 \sqrt {\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} ]
       $$
       The right limit of this interval is called the upper control limit of the \(p\) chart (\(UCL_p\)),
       the left limit of this interval is called the lower control limit (\(LCL_p\)), and \(p\) is called 
       the center line (\(CL_p\)). However, since the defective rate of the population, \(p\), 
       is not known, several samples are selected and the average rate of defective products 
       included in all selected samples, \(\overline p\), is used as an estimator of \(p\) as follows. 
       $$
         \overline p = \frac {\text {number of defective products in all samples} } {\text {number of products in all samples}} 
       $$
       The center line and control limit lines of the \(p\) chart using this estimator \(\overline p\) are as follows.
       $$
         \begin{align}
           UCL_{p} &= \overline p + 3 \sqrt {{\overline p}(1-{\overline p})/n } \\
           CL_{p}  &= \overline p \\
           LCL_{p} &= \overline p + 3 \sqrt {{\overline p}(1-{\overline p})/n } 
         \end{align}
       $$
    </div>
    <p>

    <h4>Steps for \(p\) Chart</h4>
    <div class="mainTableYellow">
         The procedure for creating a \(p\) chart using the control limit lines of the  chart is as follows.
      <p>
      <div class="textL20M20">
        <b>Step 1</b>. From the production process, select a sample of size \(n\), count the number of 
           defective products, and calculate the defective rate of the sample. Usually, the sample size 
           is set sufficiently so that the virtual defective rate of the process, \(p\), is \(np\) > 5, 
           \(n(1-p)\) > 5.
      </div>
      <p>
      <div class="textL20M20">
        <b>Step 2</b>. Repeat Step 1 \(k\) times. In other words, samples of size \(n\) are 
           continuously selected \(k\) times and the number of defective products included in each sample,
           \(x_1 , x_2 , ... x_k\), is investigated, and the defective rate of each sample,
           \({\hat p}_1 = x_1 /n ,\, {\hat p}_2 = x_2 /n ,\, ... \,, {\hat p}_k = x_k /n \), is calculated. 
           The defective rate of the total selected products, \(\overline p\), is calculated as follows. 
           The number of selected samples, \(k\), is usually between 20 and 30.
        $$
          {\overline p} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{k} {p}_{i} }{k} , 
        $$
      </div>
      <p>
      <div class="textL20M20">
        <b>Step 3</b>. Calculate the control limit lines as follows.
        <p>
        $$
         \begin{align}
           UCL_{p} &= \overline p + 3 \sqrt {{\overline p}(1-{\overline p})/n } \\
           CL_{p}  &= \overline p \\
           LCL_{p} &= \overline p - 3 \sqrt {{\overline p}(1-{\overline p})/n } 
         \end{align}
        $$
      </div>
      <p>
      <div class="textL20M20">
        <b>Step 4</b>. Draw \(CL\), \(UCL\), \(LCL\) of \(p\) chart, and write the defective rate of each sample,
           \({\hat p}_i\), in dots. Mark points that exceed the control 
           limit lines so that they can be clearly distinguished.
      </div>
      <p>
      <div class="textL20M20">
        <b>Step 5</b>. After examining the \(p\) chart, determine whether the production process is under control or not. If the defective rate of each sample does not exceed the control limits and there is no correlation in the arrangement of points, the process is under control. If the process is under control, use the prepared control limits for the next process management. If the process is out of control, the cause should be investigated and the control limits should be recalculated using the defective rates which are under control.

      <b>Answer</b>
      <p>
         Average defective rates of total samples, \(\overline p\), is as follows. 
      $$
         \begin{align}
         \overline p &= \frac {\text {number of defective products in all samples} } {\text {number of products in all samples}} \\
                     &= \frac { 291}{50 \times  25 } = \frac  { 291} {1250 } = 0.2328 
         \end{align}
      $$
         Control limits of \(p\) chart are as follows.  
      $$
         \begin{align}
          3 \sqrt {{\overline p}(1-{\overline p})/n } &= 3 \sqrt \frac { (0.2328)(0.7672)} { 50 }  = 0.1793 \\
           UCL_{p} &= 0.2328 + 0.1793 = 0.4121 \\
           CL_{p}  &= 0.2328 \\
           LCL_{p} &= 0.2328 - 0.1793 = 0.0535

         In 『eStatU』, select the menu ‘p Chart’ and enter data as in &lt;Figure 6.6.6&gt;, then click the

      <p>
         &lt;Figure 6.6.7&gt; is the \(p\) chart using the data of Table 6.6.4.
         There are three points which are outside of the control limit lines in this control chart. Therefore, the process cannot be considered to be under control. In order to ensure that the process is under control, explainable causes must be found for points which are outside of contol limits.

      <p>
         Let us assume that the following causes have been discovered for points that are outside of the control limits. In sample number 3, the defective rate increased due to the replacement of employees with employees from other departments due to diseases, in sample number 16, it was due to paralysis of the control function of the machine, and in sample number 24, it was due to the replacement of a new machine. From these observations, exclude samples which have explainable causes and the average defective rate based on the remaining samples is calculated as follows.
      $$
        {\overline {p}} = \frac {227} {1100} = 0.2027
      $$
         Control limits using the revised average defective rate are as follows. 
      $$
         \begin{align}
         UCL_p &= 0.2027 + 3 \sqrt { (0.2027)(0.7973)/50} = 0.2027+0.1706 = 0.3733 \\

      <b>Answer</b>
      <p>
         If you click the [Erase Data] button in &lt;Figure 6.6.8&gt;, data are erased, but the control limits
         are not erased as in &lt;Figure 6.6.10&gt; Enter data in Table 6.6.5 and click [Execute] button 
         to see new continued charts.
      <p>
         &lt;Figure 6.6.11&gt; shows the defective rate for sample numbers 26 to 50 using the modified control limits in Example 6.6.3. It can be seen that two points are out of control limits, with two points exceeding the upper control limit and one point exceeding the lower control limit. It is necessary to look into whether there is a possible explanation for these points. In particular, points that are outside the lower control limit require more attention and investigation into the cause. This is because by investigating the cause, methods that can significantly reduce the defective rate in the production process can be researched.
